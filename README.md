# This is a keystroke injector.
Author: [Gallifrey](https://github.com/gall1frey)

## Why
To inject keystrokes by emulating a bluetooth keyboard using a nodeMCU.

## Tech Stack
* Arduino C++
* C
* BLEkeyboard library

## How to Run
1. If you have a NodeMCU and an SD card module, upload the sketch and run it. 
2. But most probably you don't. That's okay. If you're working on implementing the keyboard functions, you only need to write the code, no testing required. Going through the library documentation should be enough.
3. If you're working on the interpreter, plug your interpreter code into ```test.c``` and compare the output with the text in ```ans1.txt``` and ```ans2.txt```

## Is it beginner Friendly?
Yes! 

## What if I have a problem?
The first step is to always google stuff. Try different searches and keywords, look through stackoverflow.
